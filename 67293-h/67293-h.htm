  <a id='Page_7'></a>
  <h2 class='c003'>1. ORIGIN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Last of the famous Marine divisions of World War <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>, the Sixth was activated on
7 September 1944 on Guadalcanal, the same island that the First Marine Division had
landed on exactly twenty five months before. Although the Sixth Marine Division was
new in name, the elements that composed it were, for the most part, as old as the
war itself. From the First Provisional Brigade that had fought so notably on Guam
came two regiments: the Fourth Marines and the Twenty Second Marines. The other
regiment of the new division came from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, where it was
organized, with the exception of its First Battalion, by Colonel Victor <abbr class='spell'>F.</abbr> Bleasdale from
handpicked officers and men.</p>

<p class='c005'>In command of the new division was Major General Lemuel <abbr class='spell'>C.</abbr> Shepherd, <abbr class='spell'>USMC</abbr>,
who had had a varied and colorful career in this war. He had trained the Ninth Marines,
afterwards a part of the Third Marine Division, and was later Assistant Division Commander
of the First Marine Division during the Gloucester operation in New Britain.
When the landings on Guam were made in July of 1944, General Shepherd (then a Brigadier)
was in command of the First Provisional Marine Brigade. His Brigade, consisting
of the Fourth and Twenty Second Marines plus reinforcing elements, fought notably on
Guam and received the Navy Unit Commendation for its excellent record.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Assistant Division Commander was Brigadier General William <abbr class='spell'>T.</abbr> Clement, <abbr class='spell'>USMC</abbr>,
another colorful figure. On the staff of Admiral Thomas Hart in the Philippines at the
outbreak of the war, General Clement (then a Colonel) left Corregidor on a submarine.
Later he served in London, and for a while was Commandant of the Marine Corps
Schools at Quantico before returning to the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of the three regiments the Twenty Second Marines was the oldest. It was formed
at San Diego in June, 1942, and the following month left for Samoa where it remained
as a part of the defense force until the fall of 1943. After an extensive training period
the regiment left Samoa and sailed to the island of Hawaii to prepare for the Marshalls
Campaign. During the Kwajalein phase it acted as a reserve and after the rapid capture
of Roi and Namur by the Fourth Marine Division, the Twenty Second Marines,
in accordance with the resulting speed-up in the Central Pacific timetable, went on to
assault Eniwetok in the Western Marshalls. After a brief but bloody fight for Eniwetok,
the regiment seized and occupied numerous adjoining islands. From Eniwetok the
Twenty Second Marines went to Guadalcanal and trained there for the Guam Campaign.
On 21 July 1944, the regiment landed on Guam on <abbr class='spell'>W</abbr>-Day as a part of the First Provisional
Brigade. It drove inland against heavy resistance and then turned to seal off
Orote Peninsula. In conjunction with the Fourth Marines, the Twenty Second drove the
length of the peninsula and destroyed the enemy emplaced there.</p>

<p class='c005'>Activated on 8 January 1944, the Fourth Marines was formed from veteran units—the
four Marine Raider Battalions. It took its name from the famous Marine regiment
that had been lost on Bataan. Its officers and men had seen action at Tulagi, Guadalcanal,
Makin, New Georgia, Bougainville; later at Guam, and abreast of the Twenty
Second Marines the new regiment received as such, its baptism of fire, when it landed
on 21 July 1944. After fighting its way inland and seizing <abbr title='mount'>Mt.</abbr> Alifan, the regiment joined
the Twenty Second to reduce heavily defended Orote Peninsula. The Fourth Marines
had been on one operation previous to Guam; it had seized the island of Emirau in
the St. Matthias Group, and although the operation was bloodless, it was a triumph in
planning and execution.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_8'></a>On 1 May 1944, the major part of the Twenty Ninth Marines was activated at Camp
Lejeune, New River, North Carolina. Two battalions were formed from the pick of officers
and men in the eastern part of the United States at that time. These battalions were
composed of some veterans but the greater part had no previous combat experience.
With reinforcing elements, the regiment (less its First Battalion) crossed the United
States by rail and sailed to Guadalcanal in August. The First Battalion joined the
regiment on Guadalcanal in early October. It had been activated from Second Marine
Division troops on Hawaii in February, 1944. First called the Second Separate Infantry
Battalion, it trained for a brief time on Hawaii and then went to Saipan for that
operation, attached to the Second Division. Landing on D-Day the battalion, now called
the First Battalion, Twenty Ninth Marines, was attached to the Eighth Marines and
to it fell the task of capturing <abbr title='mount'>Mt.</abbr> Tapotchau, the commanding terrain on Saipan. Its
losses were heavy—over 60%—and the battalion therefore was not used in the Tinian
operation, which followed.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the reinforcing elements of the First Provisional Brigade were formed, in
large part, the Sixth Tank Battalion, Sixth Pioneer Battalion, the Sixth Engineer Battalion,
and the division’s artillery regiment, the Fifteenth Marines.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>2. TRAINING AND PREPARATIONS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>When the Sixth Marine Division began its training program for its first—and only—operation,
it had several initial advantages: Over two thirds of its officers and men were
veterans, well schooled in the ways of the wily Japanese; it started off with the experience
gained from nearly four years of war; the structure of the entire division was
organized to benefit from this experience. Through October, 1944, and on into February,
1945, the division trained vigorously. Special emphasis was placed on individual marksmanship,
combat firing exercises employing all weapons and arms, night problems, flame-thrower-demolition
teams, tank-infantry problems, and air-ground problems. Training
was concluded with an eight day division problem illustrating tactical principles for
large unit employment. All through the training period General Shepherd strove to
indoctrinate his division with the spirit of attack; that it was cheaper to drive ahead
in unrelenting assault than to hesitate trying to find easier ways of achieving the objective
while troops remained in contact with the enemy. This indoctrination was to pay
dividends on Okinawa when forward progress seemed impossible.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>3. MOVEMENT TO TARGET</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>During the period 1-6 March 1945, the Sixth Marine Division was aboard ship engaged
in amphibious landing rehearsals for the Okinawa operation. On the first day
troops practiced debarkation and deployment of landing craft; on the next two days
the two assault regiments, the Fourth and Twenty Second, landed on the beaches of
Guadalcanal and practiced limited maneuvers ashore. Then followed a critique and
on the next day there was a full-scale dress rehearsal. Although limited in their extent,
the rehearsals were quite satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c005'>After breaking camp ashore, the division re-embarked to sail for the staging area,
Ulithi, on 15 March. At Ulithi, a little atoll in the Caroline Islands, the division joined
the enormous task force assembling there for the invasion of Okinawa. Training was
carried out aboard ship and final preparations made for the target. By now the troops
were aware of their destination and the force designated to land there. They were told
that the Sixth Marine Division would land simultaneously with, and on the left of, the
<a id='Page_9'></a>First Marine Division, as a part of the <abbr title='third'>III</abbr> Amphibious Corps. South of the Marines a
corps of Army, the <abbr title='twenty-fourth'>XXIV</abbr>, would land. Both of the corps were components of a larger
force—the new Tenth Army.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the way to Ulithi, while there, and on the way to the target the men were given
a thorough briefing. General Shepherd made it plain that every man should know not
only his assigned task, but that of his own unit, and of adjacent units, as well as the
general scheme of maneuver. In the briefing aboard ship the men learned that Okinawa
had a population of some 450,000 civilians; that there were roughly 70,000 Japanese
soldiers on the island. They also learned something about its geography, its towns, roads,
rivers and terrain.</p>

<p class='c005'>While at Ulithi the troops were taken ashore on the little island of Mog Mog for
rest and rehabilitation. During the staging period assault troops were transferred to
<abbr class='spell'>LST’s</abbr> for the last part of the journey. On 27 March the Sixth Marine Division left
Ulithi, loaded in 13 <abbr class='spell'>APA’s</abbr>, 24 <abbr class='spell'>LST’s</abbr> and one <abbr class='spell'>LSD</abbr>, and encountered heavy rains and
cooler weather as the convoy moved north.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>4. OKINAWA</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Easter Sunday, 1 April 1945, was Love-Day for the Okinawa operation. With the
bright clear dawn came enemy planes but the invading armada—over 1400 ships—drove
off or destroyed the attacking planes. From the transports the troops could only
see small portions of the island; the preliminary bombardment from the naval task
force and the bombs from our planes, diving through the clouds, raised a haze of
smoke and dust that covered most of the area behind the landing beaches.</p>

<p class='c005'>Forming into long waves, the Fourth and Twenty Second Marines, loaded in amphibious
tractors, churned toward the beaches, over the coral reef, and landed at 0837. Every
man went in with the expectation that this beachhead, like Tarawa, Saipan, and Iwo,
would be a bloody one; they were surprised but not entirely relieved to find virtually
no enemy opposition to the landing. Rapidly, units organized and moved inland and
up across the terraced fields that led to Yontan Airfield. By noon the Fourth Marines
had seized Yontan and the Twenty Second Marines were advancing as rapidly on the
left. By late afternoon the two regiments had reached a line tentatively set to be
reached on the second day and as yet had not found the enemy. To the left of the Twenty
Second Marines lay a little peninsula jutting out to the northwest, named Zampa Misaki.
It seemed likely that an enemy force might be there; General Shepherd requested <abbr title='third'>III</abbr>
Amphibious Corps to release from its reserve one battalion of the Twenty Ninth Marines.
The First Battalion was released to division and placed to protect the division’s
left flank. Troops dug in for the night with mixed emotions. Everyone was extremely
grateful that the landing had not been a bloody one; still there was a certain apprehension
felt: Where was the enemy? When would he attack?</p>

<p class='c005'>Love-Day had been successful beyond the wildest hopes; the division was ashore
safely, in a good position, and had already secured its first objective. Yontan Airfield
was firmly in our hands and had not been badly damaged. The enemy defensive positions
constructed to guard the field were strangely empty. Casualties were negligible; the
landing had been easy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the Sixth Marine Division moved rapidly to cut the island in two. In conjunction
with the First Marine Division which was making the main effort, the Fourth
and Twenty Second Marines drove quickly to the east and, despite some opposition
from small isolated enemy pockets, reached the east coast on 4 April. Turning to the
<a id='Page_10'></a>north, the division began to seize the Ishikawa Isthmus. Averaging nearly 7000 yards
each day the troops pushed up the isthmus and by 7 April had reached Nago at the
base of Motobu Peninsula.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>5. BATTLE FOR MOTOBU</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>It was General Shepherd’s plan to have the Twenty Second and Fourth continue
the drive up the mainland of Okinawa until Hedo Misaki was seized. To destroy the
enemy known to be on Motobu, the General committed the Twenty Ninth Marines,
which had been in Corps reserve during the first four days of the operation. For the
time being, the Fourth Marines was held as a reserve near the base of the peninsula.
Patrolling continued.</p>

<p class='c005'>Many captured enemy soldiers and civilians had stated that the main Japanese
defensive force was in southern Okinawa but that a force of about 3000 men, commanded
by a Colonel Udo, was somewhere up north, probably on Motobu. Aerial observation
and photo terrain studies confirmed indications that there was a sizeable enemy force
on the peninsula. On 8 April the Twenty Ninth Marines moved out in three columns,
one along the south coast, one along the north coast and one up the center toward
the town of Itomi. At first progress was rapid and there were few contacts made;
it was noted, however, that all inland trails were mined or blocked. The coast roads
had numerous roadblocks and tank traps. By 10 April the Third Battalion, Twenty
Ninth, was at Toguchi and had been hit by enemy artillery fire near Awa. Near Toguchi,
on the Manna road, it had contacted Udo’s force. West of Itomi the First Battalion
was also in contact with what was apparently the same force. Meanwhile the Second
Battalion had captured the enemy midget submarine base at Unten Ko but had encountered
no appreciable resistance.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the next three days the battalions were in almost constant contact with
Udo’s forces. Ambushes were frequent but the enemy could not be engaged in any decisive
action. It was clear that he was engaged in guerrilla-type warfare and wanted
to harass our troops but was trying to avoid a meeting engagement. By 13 April the
enemy position was definitely fixed as being in the <abbr title='mount'>Mt.</abbr> Yaetake area; it was known
that he had considerable artillery, mortars, and a few naval guns emplaced in hidden
positions in the wild and rugged mountain mass.</p>

<p class='c005'><abbr title='Mount'>Mt.</abbr> Yaetake provided Colonel Udo with ideal ground for defensive positions. Here
he had unlimited observation in every direction; it was impossible to attack him without
warning. The rugged character of the terrain prohibited the use of mechanized
support in the reduction of his positions.</p>

<p class='c005'>While the Twenty Ninth Marines were fixing the enemy position and determining
its character and strength, General Shepherd saw that he would need additional troops
to destroy Udo’s force. His tactical decision was to move the Fourth Marines, less the
Third Battalion, to Sakimotobu on the western side of the peninsula and attach to it
the Third Battalion, Twenty Ninth Marines which was near by. Then he ordered a
coordinated attack for 14 April with the Fourth Marines driving into Yaetake in an
easterly direction while the Twenty Ninth Marines, with two battalions, near Itomi, attacked
to the west and southwest. Udo would be hit from front and rear.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On 14 April the Fourth Marines, commanded by Colonel Alan Shapley with the
Third Battalion, Twenty Ninth, attached, moved rapidly inland to seize the first high
ground from which to launch the attack on <abbr title='mount'>Mt.</abbr> Yaetake. The Twenty Ninth Marines
found enemy dispositions to its front in such strength and on such unfavorable ground,
<a id='Page_13'></a>that it was virtually impossible to attack in a southwesterly direction.</p>

<p class='c005'>Resuming the attack on 15 April the Fourth Marines drove up the approaches to
Mt. Yaetake; fighting was bitter with one battalion commander killed and several company
commanders casualties. The First Battalion, Fourth Marines, seized a key hill mass
southwest of the Yaetake peak against heavy resistance. Over rugged terrain the Twenty
Ninth Marines continued to advance into the rear of Udo’s position against intermittent
resistance.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Map 4. Battle for Mt. Yaetake.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Next day, 16 April, the Sixth Marine Division prepared to attack the enemy from three
sides. The First Battalion, Twenty Second Marines, which had been in immediate reserve
near Awa, was ordered to advance to the north to close the gap between the two attacking
regiments. After a day of extremely hard fighting the Fourth Marines seized <abbr title='mount'>Mt.</abbr> Yaetake
and held it despite an all-out Banzai charge. Meanwhile, the Twenty Ninth Marines, now
under Colonel William <abbr class='spell'>J.</abbr> Whaling, <abbr class='spell'>USMC</abbr>, had swung its front to the west and north,
destroying fixed emplacements and enemy groups as it moved.</p>

<p class='c005'>With Udo’s force caught in the jaws of a giant nutcracker, and driven from the commanding
ground in its position, the Fourth Marines changed its tactics. Colonel Shapley
ordered his two left battalions, facing east, to initiate a holding attack on 17 April, while
the two right battalions drove down from <abbr title='mount'>Mt.</abbr> Yaetake to the north with the mission of
seizing the Manna Road. The situation on this day then, was for the two battalions to
sweep down a corridor formed by the First and Second Battalions, Twenty Ninth, on the
east and the Second Battalion, Fourth Marines, and Third Battalion, Twenty Ninth, on
the west. Down from Yaetake and through the corridor swept the First and Third Battalions,
Fourth Marines, mopping up enemy remnants as they went. Nightfall saw both
regiments on the first hills south of the Toguchi-Itomi road, the road that ran through
Manna.</p>

<p class='c005'>On 19 April the Sixth Marine Division began a coordinated drive to secure the high
ground remaining between the Toguchi-Itomi road and the north coast of the peninsula.
On the left was the Fourth Marines; next to it, the First and Second Battalions, Twenty
Ninth Marines. From Toguchi, the Third Battalion, Twenty Ninth moved by truck to
Itomi and struck out through the hills toward the highest hill mass in the northern part
of Motobu, which was seized next morning. On 20 April, the drive continued and both
regiments reached the north coast without difficulty. Little opposition had been found
in this last sweep, but it was known that several hundred enemy troops had escaped from
Motobu and were somewhere in northern Okinawa.</p>

<p class='c005'>The battle for Motobu had challenged the Sixth Division with mountain warfare of
the most rugged sort. It was costly: the Sixth Marine Division lost 207 men killed, 757
wounded and 6 missing in action. In contrast, the enemy lost 2,014 men killed. Captured
enemy material included 11 field pieces of 75 and 150-<abbr class='spell'>mm</abbr>. calibre, two six-inch naval cannon
and large numbers of mortars, machine guns and 20-<abbr class='spell'>mm</abbr>. dual purpose guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>While the other two regiments were fighting on Motobu, the Twenty Second Marines,
commanded by Colonel Merlin <abbr class='spell'>F.</abbr> Schneider, <abbr class='spell'>USMC</abbr>, continued its march up the northern
part of the mainland. On 13 April the Second Battalion moved by forced march to seize
Hedo Misaki, the northern tip of the island. Scattered resistance was encountered during
the march. Upon occupying Hedo Misaki, the regiment sent patrols down the east coast
and on 19 April, patrols from the north and south met on the east coast at Aha. By
20 April all of Okinawa north of the original landing beaches had been secured by the
Sixth Marine Division; it was known, however, that several small enemy groups still
remained at large.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_14'></a>The first of these isolated enemy groups to be located was one consisting of about
200 men. It was contacted by the First Battalion, Twenty Second Marines, near Taniyo-take,
a hill mass southeast of Motobu Peninsula. After two days of heavy fighting most
of the enemy band was destroyed although a few escaped to join another remnant of the
Motobu action. By 27 April this group had been located and from Hentona two battalions
of the Twenty Second Marines advanced toward the suspected area in a forced night
march. Meanwhile from Kawada the Third Battalion, Fourth Marines hurried inland and
made contact by noon. After considerable maneuvering, the battalion outflanked the
enemy and forced him to fight on unfavorable ground. Most of the group was destroyed;
a handful escaped.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>6. BATTLE FOR NAHA</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>During the latter part of April the Tenth Army had found its <abbr title='twenty-fourth'>XXIV</abbr> Corps heavily
engaged in southern Okinawa. It was decided that the <abbr title='third'>III</abbr> Amphibious Corps would be
assigned the western half of the southern line on about 7 May. It was further decided
that on 1 May the First Marine Division would be attached to the <abbr title='twenty-fourth'>XXIV</abbr> Corps and committed
in the vicinity of Machinato Airfield. Its mission was clear out the Jichaku plateau
area and then strike toward Shuri, the core of the Japanese defensive position. The Sixth
Marine Division would then be committed on the right of the First Division.</p>

<p class='c005'>All through the last week in April, the Sixth Division patrolled and garrisoned
northern Okinawa. Preparations were made for the move to the south. The regiments
rested, re-equipped themselves and received replacements. During the month of April
the division had traveled over 84 miles, seized 436 square miles of enemy territory, captured
46 prisoners and killed nearly 2,500 of the enemy. In the same period the division
had lost 236 men killed and 1,061 wounded in action.</p>

<p class='c005'>On 2 May the division began to move southward to assembly areas near Chibana,
east of the original landing beaches. The responsibility for the defense of northern
Okinawa passed from the Sixth Marine Division to the Twenty Seventh Infantry Division
on 4 May.</p>

<p class='c005'>According to Tenth Army order, the <abbr title='third'>III</abbr> Amphibious Corps was to assume responsibility
for the western portion of the southern front on 7 May. The First Marine Division
was already committed and was fighting to secure the high ground north and northeast
of the Asa River. The Sixth Marine Division was ordered to commit one regimental
combat team on the right of the First Division on 8 May. General Shepherd chose the
Twenty Second Marines to be committed first. Its mission was to cross the Asa and seize
the first high ground to the south. From here, the division could attack to carry out its
mission, which was: To seize Naha and the line of the Kokuba River in its zone of action,
to assist the First Marine Division by fire and maneuver, and to protect the Corps’ right
(west) flank.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Map 5. Final Drive. Motobu Peninsula.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>All during the fighting on Motobu, the men of the Sixth Marine Division had heard
stories of the fighting down south. They knew that the Tenth Army had uncovered the
main Japanese defensive positions; that the enemy had chosen rough hilly ground across
a narrow part of the island. The enemy was well dug in on a high and broken hill mass
which took its name from its geographical center—Shuri. The line, or series of lines
really, ran from north of Naha through Shuri to Yonabaru on the east coast. They had
heard that the <abbr title='twenty-fourth'>XXIV</abbr> Corps had run into a virtual stalemate; that some sixty thousand
of the enemy were offering fierce resistance from concealed positions; that the enemy
was using mortars and artillery on an unprecedented scale; and that the enemy troops
in southern Okinawa were excellent soldiers, well disciplined, and well prepared to fight
<a id='Page_17'></a>a long and costly campaign. Before the second week in May had passed the men were
certain that none of the stories were exaggerated.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the new zone of action, the Sixth Marine Division launched its first attack when
it sent the Twenty Second Marines across the Asa River in the early morning hours of
10 May. Patrols had crossed the river on the previous day and reconnoitered the ground
to its immediate south. The only bridge across the river in this sector had been totally
destroyed. Through the night of 9-10 May, the Sixth Engineer Battalion worked to construct
a footbridge. Although the little bridge was finally completed in time for the
pre-dawn attack, a group of the enemy carrying demolitions packs succeeded in destroying
themselves and a section of the bridge before many of the Marines got across.</p>

<p class='c005'>At 0330, 10 May, the First and Third Battalions of the Twenty Second Marines crossed
the Asa; the First waded across upstream on the regiment’s left, while the Third started
to use the footbridge. When it was destroyed, the battalion was forced to go upstream
and wade across. At first enemy resistance was light, but as the Japanese became aware
of this threat to their left flank, opposition became fierce. Despite heavy artillery, mortar,
and small arms fire, the troops moved on up the first ridges. By nightfall, and after a
day of heavy casualties, a bridgehead 1400 yards wide and about 400 yards deep had
been established.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next morning the reserve battalion of the Twenty Second Marines, the Second, was
committed to cover the left flank of the First which was fighting to reduce an enemy
stronghold on a formidable coral hill southeast of Asa village. When flanking action
failed to secure the hill, the troops withdrew so that naval gunfire from the USS Indianapolis
could be utilized. In the meantime the engineers labored under sporadic enemy
fire to construct a Bailey Bridge across the Asa, where the footbridge had been. About
noon the structure was completed and tanks roared across to support the troops. With
the added fire power of the tanks, the First Battalion attacked the hill again, this time
successfully. Over on the right, the Third Battalion fought for three hours before
capturing the precipitous cliff area in its zone of action.</p>

<p class='c005'>On 12 May the Twenty Second Marines, with all three battalions in the line, continued
to advance despite increasing enemy resistance. Not only was the regiment receiving
fire from its front, but also from the left flank, where the enemy in his positions
on Wana Ridge and the Shuri heights could observe troop movements and bring fire to
bear at an instant’s notice. As it became apparent that the division’s left was becoming
open, General Shepherd ordered the Third Battalion, Twenty Ninth Marines into the line
to protect the east flank. It was quite plain that another regiment would have to be
committed if the momentum of advance were to be maintained.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next day, the Sixth Marine Division continued the attack with the Second Battalion,
Twenty Second Marines and the Third Battalion, Twenty Ninth, in assault. About three
hundred yards was all that could be gained due to heavy enemy resistance. In the late
afternoon the other two battalions of the Twenty Ninth Marines moved up behind the
Third, and prepared to go into the assault on 14 May.</p>

<p class='c005'>By this time General Shepherd had discovered the following: (1) In attempting to
outflank the Shuri line, the Sixth Marine Division had uncovered the western anchor of
the enemy’s main defensive position; (2) Three terrain features, heavily fortified and
manned, and mutually supporting formed this anchor; (3) Unprotected but heavily
guarded corridors led into each of these terrain features. (4) There was no ground offering
covered routes of approach, from which these terrain features could be assaulted; (5) the
three terrain features (later called Horseshoe Ridge, Sugar Loaf Hill, and Half Moon Hill)
<a id='Page_18'></a>would be held by the enemy at all costs; if they were lost, the enemy’s main position at
Shuri would be outflanked; (6) The battle efficiency of the Twenty Second Marines was
seriously impaired; It had lost over 800 men killed or wounded since crossing the Asa;
(7) Naha, the capital city of Okinawa, lay open in front of the Twenty Second Marines,
but it could not be seized until the Sugar Loaf defensive position, Horseshoe Ridge, and
the Half Moon were reduced and cleared of enemy.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Map 6. Attack of 2nd Bn., 22nd Marines.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Commanding the surrounding countryside, Sugar Loaf Hill was the apex of a triangle.
All three elements of the triangle were mutually supporting: Horseshoe Ridge and the
Half Moon covered Sugar Loaf; from Sugar Loaf the enemy could cover the other two
with fire; all three terrain features were, in turn, under observation and fire from Shuri.
Troops attacking any one of the three hills would be subjected immediately to fire from
the other two. There was no room for extended maneuver; on the right of the division
was the sea; on the left the zone of the First Marine Division, which offered no protection
or cover.</p>

<p class='c005'>Late in the afternoon of 14 May the Second Battalion, Twenty Second, attempted a
tank-infantry assault, and despite heavy 47-<abbr class='spell'>mm</abbr>. fire that drove the tanks back, succeeded
in getting a few men from <abbr class='spell'>“G”</abbr> Company up on the top of Sugar Loaf. The attack caught
the Japanese by surprise, but only momentarily; during the night, they reorganized to
launch an attack next morning that drove the Second Battalion back from the ground
immediately to the north of Sugar Loaf, and finally spread over into the zone of the
Twenty Ninth Marines. This counterattack, in approximately battalion strength, started
a day of the bitterest fighting yet seen by the Twenty Second Marines. The desperate
character that the fight now assumed was indicative of the enemy’s resolve to hold the
Sugar Loaf system regardless of the cost. Two battalions of the Twenty Ninth, the First
and Third, encountered the same bitter fighting that was experienced by the First and
Second Battalions, Twenty Second. In the corridor leading to the Half Moon, the Third
Battalion, Twenty Ninth, finally reduced an enemy pocket that had been bypassed but had
become so troublesome as to prevent further advance. To the left, the First Battalion was
fighting in the low ground north of the Half Moon. During the afternoon of this day, 15
May, the Third Battalion, Twenty Second Marines, moved up to relieve the Second Battalion
which had lost over 400 men in the last three days. Over on the division’s right,
the First Battalion of the Twenty Second drove down the long ridge overlooking the
Asato, but could advance no further due to heavy fire from the Horseshoe and Sugar Loaf.</p>

<p class='c005'>All during the night of 15-16 May the enemy used his mortars and artillery to interdict
the front lines, causing light casualties. Early next morning the Sixth Marine Division,
with the Twenty Second and Twenty Ninth regiments in assault, again attacked to
seize the Sugar Loaf—Half Moon positions. Heavy enemy fire greeted the attack; from
near the town of Takamotoji the enemy commenced to fire, although that area had been
quiet previously. It was apparent that the enemy was moving in replacements and additional
troops to bolster the Sugar Loaf system. Working its way into position on the left
of the regimental front, the Third Battalion, Twenty Second Marines prepared to assault
Sugar Loaf Hill. Behind tanks, and after an intense artillery barrage, the battalion advanced
rapidly up the pitted north slope of the hill in the face of extremely heavy fire
from enemy mortars, grenades, and automatic weapons. Several times the battalion
reached the top of the hill and closed with the enemy in hand-to-hand fighting only to
be driven back. Finally, with losses steadily mounting, the battalion was forced to withdraw.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hope was held for a while on this day that the Twenty Ninth Marines might seize
<a id='Page_21'></a>Half Moon Hill. Closely supported by tanks, troops moved forward slowly and reached the
edge of the ridge by late afternoon. Before they could organize defensive positions, or
dig in, the enemy poured so much fire in from Shuri, Sugar Loaf, and the reverse slopes
of the Half Moon, that the troops had to withdraw under the cover of smoke. Casualties
were extremely heavy.</p>

<p class='c005'>This day, 16 May, was perhaps the bitterest day of the entire Okinawa Campaign for
the Sixth Marine Division. With all the strength at their command, two regiments had
attacked without apparent success. A week of steady fighting had reduced the offensive
capabilities of the Twenty Second Marines so General Shepherd now shifted the burden
of attack to the Twenty Ninth, leaving the Twenty Second to hold where it was.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before the Twenty Ninth Marines began the attack of 17 May, the enemy in the Sugar
Loaf area was subjected to a terrific bombardment which included 16-inch shells from the
main batteries of battleships, 8-inch howitzer shells, and 1000-pound aerial bombs. With
tanks in close support and immediately behind a heavy and continuing artillery barrage,
the First and Third Battalions, Twenty Ninth Marines edged their way to the northern
edge of Half Moon Hill. Finally the Third Battalion seized a slim foothold on the north-western
edge of the hill but intense enemy fire made the position untenable and the troops
were forced to withdraw. Meanwhile <abbr class='spell'>“E”</abbr> Company of the Second Battalion was attempting
a flanking attack around the east side of Sugar Loaf Hill. Despite heavy enemy mortar
barrages and grenade fire, the company drove to the top of the hill three times; each
time the enemy counterattacked and drove the men off. Finally at 1830 in the last vestige
of light, the company mustered strength enough to assault the hill again. This time when
it reached the top it beat off an enemy counterattack, but had so few men left, and so
many wounded to be evacuated, that it had to pull back to better ground for the night.</p>

<p class='c005'>At dusk, but while there was still enough light to be seen, the enemy attempted to
reinforce Sugar Loaf and began to move his troops in the open. Almost immediately
twelve battalions of our artillery took the enemy troops under time-on-target fire and
inflicted such heavy losses that the reinforcement threat was broken up. While the Half
Moon and Sugar Loaf still remained in enemy hands, the division had made gains that
were not yet perceptible. There was no way of knowing as yet the extent of the enemy’s
losses. So far, he had been able to move in enough reinforcements to counter our attacks,
but his losses had reached the point where he could no longer readily replace them. Meanwhile,
the Twenty Ninth Marines had got into position for the final attack, which was
to be launched next day.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At 0830, 18 May, the First and Third Battalions, Twenty Ninth again assaulted the
enemy on the Half Moon. After a foothold was established the fighting resolved itself into
a slugging match, and this enabled the Second Battalion to make its move. It first attempted
to encircle Sugar Loaf with tanks but enemy mines, 47-<abbr class='spell'>mm.</abbr> fire, and artillery
fire disabled six tanks and drove the rest back.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Map 8. Attack of 4-Th Marines.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Next, the Second Battalion launched a combined tank-infantry assault on Sugar
Loaf, working the tanks, closely supported by troops, around each flank of the hill simultaneously.
One tank accompanied by troops, edged its way around the west side of the
hill and commenced firing into the enemy’s reverse slope defenses. Then, as the enemy
moved to repel this threat, another tank worked its way around the east side of the hill
and emptied its machine guns into the backs of the defenders of Sugar Loaf. In the ensuing
pandemonium troops swarmed all over the hill and, after an hour of heavy fighting,
the hill was firmly held by Marines. <abbr class='spell'>“F”</abbr> Company was sent to seize the Horseshoe and
reduce the mortar positions there that were firing on Sugar Loaf. The company moved
<a id='Page_22'></a>rapidly across the intervening ground, climbed up on the Horseshoe, and engaged the
enemy in a hand grenade battle. During the night the enemy counterattacked and drove
<abbr class='spell'>“F”</abbr> Company back to Sugar Loaf but could not regain the lost hill. Over on the left of the
zone of action of the Twenty Ninth Marines, the First and Third Battalions held their
positions at the base of the Half Moon, despite heavy enemy fire. For the action during the
period 14-19 May, the Twenty Ninth Marines, and attached units, were awarded the Presidential
Unit Citation.</p>

<p class='c005'>In order to exploit the recently won gains General Shepherd ordered the Fourth
Marines fresh after a two weeks’ rest, to relieve the Twenty Ninth on 19 May. On the right
of the division’s front, the Twenty Second Marines remained in position, but were in no
condition to continue the attack. After relieving the Twenty Ninth Marines, the Fourth
prepared to attack next day to seize the upper reaches of the Asato River. The night of
19 May saw the enemy making full use of his mortars and artillery but casualties were
light. Next morning the Fourth Marines attacked Horseshoe Ridge and managed to seize a
part of it. While the fighting raged, the enemy on the Shuri Hill mass turned his weapons
and hit the flank of the Fourth with heavy fire. At 2130, following a terrific 90-mm. mortar
barrage, the enemy commenced to counterattack with Sugar Loaf as the objective. Centering
on the Third Battalion, Fourth Marines, the counterattack continued until midnight.
During this time naval star shells kept the critical area illuminated and six battalions
of artillery fired to break up the counterattack. Before the enemy was driven back, it was
necessary to commit part of the regimental reserve. In this unsuccessful counterattack,
the enemy lost nearly 300 killed while the Fourth Marines only lost 1 man killed and 19
wounded.</p>

<p class='c005'>On 21 May the Fourth Marines made slight gains in the interior of Horseshoe Ridge
but the foothold on the Half Moon could not be expanded. Until Shuri fell it would be
virtually impossible to take the Half Moon in its entirety. It was futile to attack on the
left. Now the emphasis was shifted to the regiment’s right and on the morning of 22 May
the front lines advanced slowly to the Asato.</p>

<p class='c005'>Employing a holding attack on the extreme left of the division front, General Shepherd
was ready to exploit his gains. After a thorough reconnaissance of the ground just
across the Asato, the Fourth Marines moved two battalions across the river during the
afternoon of 23 May and ran into determined enemy resistance. The position of the Fourth
Marines, while not precarious, was extremely difficult. Two attempts to bridge the Asato
had failed; all food, water and ammunition had to be carried across by hand. The past
three days had brought unusually heavy rains and the entire division zone of action was
a sea of mud. Wading through mud ankle deep, stretcher bearers had a hard time getting
the wounded back to evacuation points north of the rear. Few vehicles could negotiate
the morass of mud that characterized the area. These rains were to continue until the
last of May.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/map09.jpg' alt='Map 9. Attack of Fourth Marines. Asato River Area.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Map 9. Attack of Fourth Marines. Asato River Area.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On 25 May the Fourth Marines resumed the attack and seized most of the north-south
ridge line west of Machishi. About a company of the enemy counterattacked during the
night and spent its force in the sector of the Third Battalion. While the Fourth Marines
were moving into the eastern outskirts of Naha, the Division Reconnaissance Company
crossed the Asato near its mouth and penetrated the urban portion of Naha west of the
north-south canal. Enemy resistance was very light; only a few snipers harassed the company.
Next day, with the heavy rain still falling, the Fourth Marines confined its efforts
to vigorous patrolling. The reconnaissance company moved 300 yards further into Naha.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unmistakable signs on 26 May pointed toward a Japanese withdrawal from the Shuri
<a id='Page_23'></a>position. In order to determine the extent of the withdrawal to the front of the Sixth
Marine Division, all units commenced patrolling. Part of the Second Battalion, Twenty
Second Marines, crossed the Asato and passed through the Reconnaissance Company while
pushing farther into Naha. The city was almost a total wreck. Only a few buildings around
the outskirts remained standing and these were badly damaged. During the day the
Fourth Marines sent patrols over 300 yards forward of the lines and found only light opposition.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again General Shepherd reoriented his attack; he ordered the Twenty Second Marines
to complete the capture of Naha and be prepared to advance through the hills that overlook
the Kokuba River from the north. At the same time, he ordered the Twenty Ninth
Marines to relieve the Fourth, and to be prepared to continue the attack to the southeast
toward the Shichina hills. On 28 May the Twenty Ninth Marines commenced to relieve the
Fourth Marines; at the same time, the Twenty Second Marines completed the capture
of urban Naha, the part that lies to the west of the north-south canal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Initially, the Twenty Ninth Marines were to carry out a holding attack while supporting
the Twenty Second Marines by fire. On 29 May, with the Twenty Ninth Marines holding
on its left, the Twenty Second Marines crossed the north-south canal and commenced to
fight through the low hills that lead to Shichina, and parallel the Kokuba River. The
attack moved rapidly at first on the right but the enemy rear guard, stationed in the hills
to the front of the two regiments, began to resist more fiercely, and it wasn’t until 1 June
that the two regiments were able to clean out the enemy in the Shichina area; now the
division could look down from its position above the Kokuba and see the Naha-Yonabaru
cross-island highway. Across the river, troops could see destroyed materiel abandoned by
the enemy in his hasty withdrawal to the south.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Twenty Second Marines rested now for the first time since crossing the Asa River
on 10 May. For this period the regiment, and its attached units, was awarded the Presidential
Unit Citation. In the drive from the Asa to the Kokuba casualties had been heavy.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>7. BATTLE FOR OROKU</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>After the seizure of Naha and the area to its east the Sixth Marine Division prepared
to continue its drive to the south by making an amphibious landing on Oroku. General
Shepherd ordered his Division Reconnaissance Company, a flexible group that worked under
<abbr class='spell'>G</abbr>-2 or <abbr class='spell'>G</abbr>-3 as the situation demanded, to cross the estuary during the night of 1-2
June and reconnoiter possible landing beaches as well as explore the area inland where
the beachhead would be established. Using plastic boats, the company made its reconnaissance
and returned to Naha at 0300, 2 June, to report that the northern part of Oroku
Peninsula was occupied by the enemy but not in great strength.</p>

<p class='c005'>The plan for the reduction of enemy forces on Oroku was simple and complete; it
left the Japanese no alternatives except to surrender or die. The Fourth Marines were to
make a dawn landing on 4 June and as the beachhead expanded, the Twenty Ninth Marines
were to go in on the left of the Fourth. With two regiments attacking abreast, the
plan called for the other regiment, the Twenty Second Marines, to throw a cordon-like
line across the base of the peninsula in conjunction with the First Marine Division as it
crossed both forks of the Kokuba river and drove south. Then with the Twenty Second
facing northwest and preventing the enemy from escaping, the two assault regiments
would drive east and southeast to exterminate the enemy defenders of Oroku.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the rainy weather of the last week in May and the first few days in June, the
Sixth Marine Division faced a tremendous logistical problem. Initially the assault regiments
<a id='Page_24'></a>would have to be supplied by amphibious craft over the same route used for the
landing. As the attack moved to the southeast, there was a chance that the Naha Estuary
could be bridged by using little Ona Yama island, which lay in the center of the estuary,
almost equidistant from Naha and Oroku. There were a few of the enemy on Ono Yama;
these would have to be killed before the engineers could commence their bridging efforts.
Simultaneously then, with the landing of the Fourth Marines on Oroku, the Sixth Reconnaissance
Company was ordered to land on, and secure, Ono Yama. All through 2-3 June
amphibious trucks (<abbr class='spell'>DUKWS</abbr>) and tractors carried supplies and equipment over impassable
roads to the beach at Naha where the landing was to be launched.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/map10.jpg' alt='Map 10. Beachhead On Oroku.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Map 10. Beachhead On Oroku.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Before dawn, 4 June, the preliminary bombardment commenced on Oroku and Ono
Yama. At 0551, the Fourth Marines landed two battalions without any great difficulty.
Early enemy resistance was light and the troops moved rapidly inland. At 1000 the Twenty
Ninth Marines commenced to load a battalion to send across to join the Fourth. In the
meantime, the Division Reconnaissance Company had landed on Ono Yama and killed a
handful of Japanese.</p>

<p class='c005'>Defending Oroku were mixed troops. There were some regular units, some Okinawa
Home Guardsmen, and some were naval and air personnel from units stationed at Naha
Port, and Naha Airfield. The rough character of the terrain on Oroku, with the exception
of the flat ground around the airfield, lent itself to the defenders. From carefully prepared
cave positions they could use the machine guns, 40 and 20-<abbr class='spell'>mm</abbr>. antiaircraft guns that had
been stripped from the defenses of the airfield. This enemy group on Oroku, some 5000
strong, had resigned themselves to making a last ditch stand on the peninsula. Initially,
however, the amphibious landing of the Fourth Marines caught them by surprise. With
the advance of the First Division across the Kokuba toward Itoman, the enemy apparently
decided that Oroku would be attacked from its base, not its northwest tip, and was originally
deployed to fight off any thrust from the base.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/map11.jpg' alt='Map 11. Front Lines On Oroku.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Map 11. Front Lines On Oroku.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was indeed unfortunate then, that because of two factors beyond its control, the
Sixth Marine Division was not afforded the opportunity of really capitalizing on its tactical
surprise to the enemy. The rainy weather through the latter part of May and early
June had made Oroku extremely muddy. What few roads there were that led inland from
the landing beaches were either mined or had sections blown out so that our tanks could
not use them. The rice paddies, fields and hills, ankle to knee deep with mud, were heavily
mined, precluding the possibility of tank movement and causing the infantry to move with
utmost caution. At a time when speed could have meant rapid gains, the division found
itself forced to let the rifle companies fight as best they could and without many of their
supporting arms. The brief respite gained by the enemy allowed him to redeploy his forces
to resist the attack of the Fourth and Twenty Ninth Marines.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/map12.jpg' alt='Map 12. Last Pocket of Resistance on Oroku.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Map 12. Last Pocket of Resistance on Oroku.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It wasn’t until 13 June that the enemy forces on Oroku were destroyed. The Fourth
Marines, after landing on 4 June, had seized the first hills inland and then as the Twenty
Ninth came in on the left, the Fourth secured Naha Airfield and drove to the southeast
in an encircling maneuver. Facing the enemy from the east, the Twenty Second Marines
kept him bottled up and harassed his rear. On the left, driving down the long ridge that
parallels the estuary, the Twenty Ninth moved slowly. In the extreme broken terrain that
characterized Oroku, the enemy resisted fiercely using all the weapons at his command to
prevent the advancing Marines from crossing the numerous compartments, and denying
them the use of the corridors.</p>

<p class='c005'>The advance was slow and the action costly. In addition to his automatic weapons,
small arms, grenade discharges and mortars, the enemy had 320-<abbr class='spell'>mm</abbr>. spigot mortars and
<a id='Page_27'></a>artillery. Cut off, surrounded, and assaulted from all sides, the enemy was exacting a final
price for the peninsula. It was not until 12 June that the first real break in his carefully coordinated
defense became apparent. On this day, converging forces of the Fourth Marines
and the Twenty Ninth had the enemy completely encircled. From his positions, the enemy
could look to the northwest and see the Twenty Ninth; turning to the south, he could see
the Fourth Marines driving in on his flank; behind him was the Twenty Second Marines,
moving in slowly to complete his doom.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the afternoon of 12 June, some enemy groups came out waving white surrender
flags. Others refused to surrender and pressed grenades to their stomachs. Still others allowed
themselves to be killed while offering only feeble resistance. In most, the will to live
was gone; they were resigned to their fate. Next day, 861 Japanese were killed and 73
taken prisoner.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before the capture of Oroku could be called complete, there remained to be taken the
small island of Senaga Shima. After a heavy preliminary bombardment, the Sixth Division’s
Reconnaissance Company, with a company from the Twenty Ninth Marines attached,
landed on the island and quickly seized it. Only two of the enemy were found and
killed but many fine coastal guns were captured. Now the battle for Oroku was over. The
enemy had resisted bitterly, 1,608 Marines were killed or wounded in the capture of the
peninsula, and thirty of our tanks were lost. During the ten days of fighting the Sixth
Marine Division had killed almost 5,000 Japanese and had captured nearly 200. For its
excellent work in landing on the peninsula, seizing the airdrome and then driving around
the enemy’s position to overwhelm him from the flank, the Fourth Marines was awarded
the Presidential Unit Citation.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>8. END OF CAMPAIGN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>On 15 June the <abbr title='third'>III</abbr> Amphibious Corps instructed the Sixth Marine Division to be
prepared to pass through the right of the First Marine Division on Mezado Ridge on 17
June. The mission assigned the Sixth Marine Division was to seize Kuwanga Ridge, part
of Ibaru Ridge, and the Kiyamu Gusuku hill mass. Although their plight was hopeless,
the enemy still held out in the southernmost part of Okinawa, evidently intent upon
exacting as stiff a price, in terms of lives, as possible before being destroyed. Like a trapped
animal, the Japanese were resisting bitterly and from their positions on the hills and
ridges, were delaying the attackers as long as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>With its zone of action limited in width, the Sixth Division committed the Twenty
Second Marines at 0300, 17 June. To reach Mezado Ridge, the regiment had to advance
past Kunishi through open ground swept by enemy fire. During the hours of daylight, the
First Division, fighting on Kunishi and Mezado Ridge, was forced to use tanks to supply
the front lines and evacuate the wounded. By moving before daylight the Twenty Second
Marines had little difficulty in reaching positions from which to launch an attack to secure
Mezado Ridge. After an intense preliminary artillery, naval gunfire, and aerial bombardment
on Mezado Ridge, Hill 69 and Kuwanga Ridge, the First and Third Battalions attacked
at 0730. The advance was slow and difficult due to increasing enemy resistance.
With every weapon at his command the enemy brought fire to bear on the assault battalions.
By late afternoon the attack had moved up on the western part of Mezado Ridge;
the Third Battalion had captured the key high ground around Hill 69, and could see
Kuwanga Ridge to the south.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next morning, 18 June, the Twenty Second Marines continued the attack, passing
the Second Battalion through the Third, which was left to mop up in its immediate area.
<a id='Page_28'></a>Against heavy resistance the Second Battalion advanced to Kuwanga Ridge and by late
afternoon had a firm hold on the ridge. While moving through the Mezado Area to inspect
his regiment’s attack, Colonel <abbr class='spell'>H. C.</abbr> Roberts, <abbr class='spell'>USMC</abbr>, the Commanding Officer of the Twenty
Second Marines, was shot through the heart by a sniper.</p>

<p class='c005'>Although the Second Battalion had a foothold on Kuwanga Ridge, it could not hold
the entire length of the ridge, some 1800 yards, and General Shepherd decided to move
up a battalion of the Fourth Marines on the left in order to hold the ridge through the
night. On the next day he could continue the attack to the south with a fresh regiment.</p>

<p class='c005'>Early in the morning of 19 June, the Fourth Marines with the First and Third Battalions
abreast, assaulted Ibaru Ridge and, after a brisk fight, had seized the ridge by
noon. After a hasty reorganization on the ridge, the regiment attacked again, this time
to capture the Kiyamu-Gusuku hill mass. Immediately upon leaving Ibaru the Fourth
Marines ran into heavy enemy fire from mortars emplaced behind the hill mass and
machine guns firing from concealed positions on it. Just before dark the regiment succeeded
in gaining a small foot hold on the high plateau of the hill mass. During the
afternoon the little island just offshore from Nagasuku was seized by a quickly assembled
task force consisting of three amphibious tractors, two 37-<abbr class='spell'>mm</abbr>. platoons and a War Dog
platoon. In the brief action 20 Japanese soldiers were killed and 8 taken prisoner.</p>

<p class='c005'>On 19 June the Sixth Marine Division committed two battalions of the Twenty Ninth
Marines on the right of the Fourth Marines in preparation for a final assault to seize the
5000 square yards of ground remaining. Next day at 0700 both regiments attacked, the
Twenty Ninth to drive to the coast, and the Fourth to complete the seizure of the Kiyamu-Gusuku
Ridge. Against light opposition, the Twenty Ninth Marines advanced rapidly and
reached the southern coast. Harassing long range fire from the regiment’s left caused few
casualties. The enemy in this sector began to surrender. An <abbr class='spell'>LCI</abbr>, equipped with a loud-speaker,
moved along the coast calling to the remaining Japanese to give themselves up.
Over 700 Japanese officers and men surrendered during the day.</p>

<p>Map 13. Battle for Ara-Saki Peninsula.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile over on the division’s left, the Fourth Marines were engaged in a bloody
fight to secure Kiyamu-Gusuku Ridge. From their positions in the hill mass the Japanese
resisted desperately with intense mortar and small arms fire. After a day of bitter fighting
the Second Battalion captured Hill 80, the peak of the hill mass, but the remainder of the
ground was still held by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Resuming its attack on 21 June the Fourth Marines turned from frontal assaults and
flanking attacks to a double envelopment from the rear. Early in the morning the two
flank battalions sent companies around either extremity of the ridge and at 0800 struck
the enemy’s rear in a coordinated attack. For two hours the enemy fought back bitterly
but could not halt the assaulting Marines. With the fall of the Kiyamu-Gusuku Ridge
all organized resistance in the Sixth Marine Division’s zone of action ceased.</p>

<p class='c005'>During all but thirteen of the eighty two days that the Okinawa Campaign lasted, the
Sixth Marine Division was committed and actively engaged. Credited to the division were
23,000 Japanese killed and over 3,500 captured. The division had captured over two thirds
of Okinawa and had repeatedly fought the enemy on his own terms, and his own ground.
During this operation the Sixth Marine Division had taken heavy losses; 400 officers and
7,822 enlisted men were either killed or wounded. In the drive from the Asa River to the
Kokuba, the division had lost the equivalent of a regiment of men. Not included in the
above figures are men lost due to non-battle casualties, sickness, or combat fatigue.</p>

<p class='c005'>After reaching the southern coast the Sixth Division turned to retrace its steps back
to the Kokuba, mopping up enemy remnants at it went.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_31'></a>The first week in July found the Sixth Marine Division busy with preparations for the
trip to the new base camp on Guam. On 4 July there was an impressive ceremony held
to dedicate the division cemetery. Although the division was preparing to leave Okinawa,
it paused briefly to pay its respects to those of its members who would have to remain
forever behind. In the last paragraph of the special order of dedication, General Shepherd
admonished his men as follows:</p>

<p class='c005'>“As this cemetery is dedicated to the dead and to the past that they made glorious
by their heroic sacrifices, let there be in the minds of the members of this division the resolve
to dedicate their future efforts to speeding the impending final defeat of the enemy
to the end that there will no longer be occasion for the sacrifice that the honored dead of
our division were called upon to make on this island.”</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>9. GUAM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>On 16 July General Shepherd and his staff arrived at Guam and set up his new command
post. By direction of Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, a base camp had been built for the
Sixth Marine Division on Guam. As soon as the units had moved into their new areas,
construction was begun on chapels and recreation facilities. A division training order was
issued on 23 July outlining a program to last from 6 August to 15 December 1945.</p>

<p class='c005'>On 26 July General Shepherd published a letter of gratitude from the people of Guam
to the officers and men of the Sixth Marine Division. Written on the occasion of “Guam
Liberation Day”, 21 July, one year after the Fourth and Twenty Second Marines had
landed on the bloody beaches near Agat, the letter, signed by several leading Guamanians
said in part:</p>

<p class='c005'>“On behalf of the people of Guam we take this opportunity, as a token of everlasting
gratitude, to extend our greetings and felicitations to you, the officers and men of the
First Provisional Brigade which formed the nucleus of the Sixth Marine Division, with
its supporting arms and services, on the first anniversary of <abbr class='spell'>D</abbr>-Day.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Through popular request, the twenty first of July has been designated as ‘Guam
Liberation Day’. It is fitting and proper that we renew and reaffirm our loyalty and devotion
to our mother country and the cause for which she stands.”</p>

<p class='c005'>With general preparations for future combat operations against the enemy underway,
the Sixth Marine Division launched an intensive training program in August. The main
effort of the division was diverted, however, from 11-15 August to preparing and mounting
out Task Group Able for the forthcoming occupation of Yokosuka Naval Base. This task
group was a headquarters command headed by Brigadier General William <abbr class='spell'>T.</abbr> Clement
which was superimposed over the Fourth Marines (Reinforced), under the command of
<abbr title='lieutenant'>Lt.</abbr> <abbr title='colonel'>Col.</abbr> Fred <abbr class='spell'>D.</abbr> Beans. On 16 August, Task Group Able departed from Guam and three
days later joined the Third Fleet.</p>

<p class='c005'>As a part of the Fleet Landing Force, Task Group Able landed at Yokosuka Naval
Base and Airfield on 30 August. There was no opposition to the landing. Here it remained
as a part of the Sixth Marine Division until late in November when it passed from the
administrative control of the division to that of Fleet Marine Force, Pacific. Its general
duties consisted of demilitarizing the Naval area of responsibility, and in providing security
for the Naval Base and Airfield. On 20 September, all reinforcing elements of the
Fourth Marines and its superior command, Task Force Able Headquarters, returned to
Guam, leaving the regiment under the operational control of the Eighth Army. By January
the force had been reduced to the Third Battalion; the other two battalions, Weapons
Company, and Headquarters and Service Company departed for the <abbr class='spell'>U. S.</abbr> to be disbanded.
Later a reduced regimental headquarters group left for Tsingtao to rejoin the division.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_32'></a>
  <h2 class='c003'>10. TSINGTAO</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>During the month of September the Sixth Marine Division prepared for an operation,
the forthcoming occupation of Tsingtao, China. From 2 October until 11 October the
division was aboard ship en route to China and commenced unloading at Tsingtao on the
latter date.</p>

<p class='c005'>While aboard the division command ship en route to Tsingtao, General Shepherd
stated the general mission of his command:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Our mission is to land and occupy Tsingtao and the adjacent Tsangkou Airfield;
to assist local authorities in maintaining order and in preventing disease and starvation;
to release, care for, and evacuate Recovered Allied Military personnel and Allied internees;
to cooperate with Chinese Central Government forces; to accept, when necessary, local
surrender of Japanese forces, as authorized by higher authority, and to assist the Chinese
in effecting the disarming and confining of these forces.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The city of Tsingtao, with 1,300,000 inhabitants is situated on a promontory on the
southern coast of Shantung Peninsula. It is regarded as one of the finest ports in China,
and is second only to Shanghai as a textile manufacturing center. When the division
landed, it found the citizens of Tsingtao to be a polyglot group: Communist agents, former
Nazis, White Russians, Koreans, Japanese civilians, Japanese military personnel, Europeans,
Eurasians, and Chinese.</p>

<p class='c005'>Politically, Tsingtao, as the most coveted city on Shantung Peninsula, was a hotbed
of intrigue and strife. The Communists, with a stronghold at Chefoo, hoped to gain control
of the peninsula, and the city. Resisting them were Japanese troops, protecting rail lines
leading into the city. Here too, were independent factions ostensibly aligned with the
Chungking government. Still in evidence, but ineffective, were puppet groups. At large,
but not easily identified with either Chungking or Yennan, were small groups of brigands
which terrorized Tsingtao despite the Mayor and his poorly trained and discipined troops.</p>

<p class='c005'>Most of the interior of the Shantung Peninsula was controlled by Communists; their
only access to the sea was at the port of Chefoo. Early in the month of October an emissary
from the Commander-in-Chief of the Liberation Army of the Communists entered the
harbor and sought an audience with General Shepherd. Permission was granted and a
letter was presented which proposed, in essence, passive collaboration between the Marines
and the Communists. Offering to enter the city to “restore order” by killing puppet troops,
that is those troops who professed allegiance to Chiang Kai-Shek’s Chinese Central Government,
the Communists promised not to disturb the Marines of the Sixth Division. To
this General Shepherd replied firmly that he would have no part in a fratricidal war between
factions in China, and that his combat veterans could prevent any disorders in
the city.</p>

<p class='c005'>Obviously, the Communist forces had hoped to gain complete control of the Shantung
Peninsula at the cessation of hostilities through the surrender of Japanese troops to them.</p>

<p class='c005'>One of the earliest problems to confront the men of the Sixth Marine Division in
Tsingtao was a financial one, the fluctuating rate of exchange. With inflation rampant,
attempts to stabilize the exchange at one American dollar to 2,000 Chinese Federal Reserve
Bank dollars failed. Black markets flourished for a while and speculation in local currency
helped to make that currency unstable. Food was plentiful but there was a shortage of
coal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Law and order was more a matter of theory than practice. Throughout October uniformed
Chinese perpetrated many small crimes against both the Japanese and German
<a id='Page_33'></a>residents. These usually consisted of breaking into houses, threatening the occupants with
rifles or pistols, and stealing jewelry, silver, or small valuables. Marine roving patrols
remedied this situation. It wasn’t long before the Sixth Marine Division found itself regarded
as the guardian of minority groups within the city.</p>

<p class='c005'>The morning of 25 October found the Twenty Second Marines, the Twenty Ninth
Marines, the Sixth Tank Battalion, the Sixth Engineers, the Sixth Marine Division Headquarters
Battalion, and other troops, marching out to the race track at the edge of Tsingtao
to witness the surrender ceremony of the Japanese to representatives of the United
States and Chinese Central Governments.</p>

<p class='c005'>At 1100 the ceremony began. For the Japanese, <abbr title='major'>Maj.</abbr> General Eiji Nagano, commanding
officer of the Japanese <abbr title='fifth'>5th</abbr> Independent Mixed Brigade, stepped up on the platform and
affixed his signature to copies of the surrender document. After laying his sword on the
table Nagano withdrew to rejoin his staff, who immediately followed his example. On the
platform representing the United States was General Shepherd who signed his name next.
<abbr title='lieutenant'>Lt.</abbr> <abbr title='general'>Gen.</abbr> Yen Nien Li, deputy commander of the 11th War Area and Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-Shek’s personal representative, signed for the Chinese Central Government.</p>

<p class='c005'>The surrender document stated that all Japanese forces in the Tsingtao area were
to surrender unconditionally to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek and that all equipment
and records were to be turned over to the Allies in good condition. Civilian internees and
prisoners of war were to be released immediately. General Shepherd, as Commanding
General of the Sixth Marine Division, was named as Chiang’s authorized representative.</p>

<p class='c005'>By the end of October, the division had settled to its routine duties. Guards had been
established over American properties and Japanese warehouses; patrols were maintained
throughout the non-Chinese sections of the city. A new training program was started.
Special Services distributed athletic gear and arranged athletic events; in addition, an
education program had been started. The division began to make plans for withdrawal as
soon as the <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr> Chinese National Army arrived. By 23 November, before a lapse occurred,
6,701 Japanese military personnel and 877 Japanese civilians had been evacuated to
Japan. Along with the repatriation of the Japanese, many members of the division were
“repatriated” to the United States through rotation as point scores dropped.</p>

<p class='c005'>During the month of December the Sixth Marine Division continued its duties in
Tsingtao; 7,827 military and 18,390 civilian Japanese were repatriated. Near the end of
the month Major General <abbr class='spell'>A. F.</abbr> Howard, <abbr class='spell'>USMC</abbr>, arrived to relieve Major General Lemuel
<abbr class='spell'>C.</abbr> Shepherd, Jr., <abbr class='spell'>USMC</abbr>, as Commanding General of the Sixth Marine Division.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gradually many of the functions of the division were absorbed by the <abbr title='eighth'>8th</abbr> Chinese
National Army and the division turned to schools and training prior to deactivation on
1 April, when from its units the Third Marine Brigade was formed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The career of the Sixth Marine Division had been relatively brief, a few days less than
nineteen months, but in that short time the division had won a respected position among
the fighting divisions of this war. For its excellent work on Okinawa the division was
warmly commended by both <abbr title='lieutenant'>Lt.</abbr> General Roy <abbr class='spell'>S.</abbr> Geiger, Commanding General, <abbr title='third'>III</abbr> Amphibious
Corps, and the late <abbr title='lieutenant'>Lt.</abbr> General Simon <abbr class='spell'>B.</abbr> Buckner, Commanding General, Tenth
Army. To each of the three infantry regiments of the Sixth Marine Division, the Twenty
Second Marines, the Twenty-Ninth Marines and the Fourth Marines, went the highly
coveted Presidential Unit Citation. While it lived, the division not only upheld all the
proud traditions of the Marine Corps, but added to the impressive record of brave deeds
long associated with the Corps.</p>

<p class='c005'>1. I wish to express my appreciation of the heroic part played
by the officers and men of the <abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Battalion, <abbr title='twenty-ninth'>29th</abbr> Marines (Reinf),
while attached to the <abbr title='second'>2d</abbr> Marine Division, in the defeat of the
Japanese forces on Saipan.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. This battalion landed on the Japanese base of Saipan,
Marianas Islands, on <abbr class='spell'>D</abbr>-day, 15 June 1944, and immediately upon
landing was attached to <abbr class='spell'>CT</abbr>-8 and subsequently committed to front-line
action on the original beachhead. For a period of twenty
days until the zone of action of this division was completely
secured, it occupied front-line positions, participating in attacks
against most determined resistance over the most difficult
terrain the island offered. During this entire period, due to
tactical considerations and the nature of enemy resistance, it was
at no time relieved from its front-line positions. In its advance
over very difficult terrain, including the main ridge of Mount
Tapotchau, the commanding terrain feature of the island, it successfully
repulsed numerous counter-attacks and overcame many
pockets of inordinately tenacious enemy resistance, including
heavy machine gun and mortar fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. In its advance it suffered very heavy casualties. Despite
these losses, this battalion continued its attacks and advances
with unabating vigor and persistence.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. It has been a pleasure to have under my command these
officers and men who were of inestimable value to the success of
the operation as a part of the <abbr title='second'>2d</abbr> Marine Division, Reinforced. The
parent organization of the <abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Battalion, <abbr title='twenty-ninth'>29th</abbr> Marines can well
be proud of the accomplishments of this battalion during the Saipan
operation.</p>

<p class='c005'>1. The article, “BATTALION ON SAIPAN” by War Correspondent
Robert Sherrod, appearing in the October 1944 issue of the MARINE
CORPS GAZETTE describes the splendid part played in the conquest
of Saipan during June and July 1944, by the battalions of the Sixth
Marine Regiment. However, in addition to his description of the
fighting done by the battalions of the Sixth Marine Regiment, Mr.
Sherrod includes the following reference to the magnificent
achievements of the First Battalion, Twenty-ninth Marines:</p>

<p class='c010'>“And none of them (battalions of the Sixth Marine Regiment)
approached the rather appalling losses incurred by an
extra battalion formed of detachments from each of the nine
regular battalions of the Second Division. This heroic battalion,
the First Battalion, Twenty-ninth Marine Regiment,
commanded first by Lieutenant Colonel Guy <abbr class='spell'>E.</abbr> Tannyhill and
later by Lieutenant Colonel Rathvon <abbr class='spell'>McC.</abbr> Tompkins (until he
was also wounded near the end of the battle), faced the fearsome
task of taking the 1,554-foot peak of Mount Tapotchau,
the highest point on Saipan. Like good Marines, Colonel
Tompkins’ men never faltered in their assignment, but there
were only about 200 left in the battalion when the battle ended.
The United States can thank its lucky stars for such picked
men who are not afraid to die; without them it is difficult to
see how the Pacific war would even now be advanced as far as
Tarawa, which is 2,000 miles to the rear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>2. The officers and men of the <abbr title='twenty-ninth'>29th</abbr> Marines are very proud
of the splendid reputation already established by our First

21 to August 10, 1944. Functioning as a combat unit for the first
time, the First Provisional Marine Brigade forced a landing
against strong hostile defenses and well camouflaged positions,
steadily advancing inland under the relentless fury of the enemy’s
heavy artillery, mortar and small arms fire to secure a firm beachhead
by nightfall. Executing a difficult turning movement to the
north, this daring and courageous unit fought its way ahead yard
by yard through mangrove swamps, dense jungles and over cliffs
and, although terrifically reduced in strength under the enemy’s
fanatical counterattacks, hunted the Japanese in caves, pillboxes
and foxholes and exterminated them. By their individual acts
of gallantry and their indomitable fighting teamwork throughout
this bitter and costly struggle, the men of the First Provisional
Marine Brigade aided immeasurably in the restoration of Guam to
our sovereignty.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>1. The Commanding General takes pleasure in announcing that
all organized enemy resistance in the central and northern part
of OKINAWA was overcome on April 20, 1945.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Within a period of twenty days, the Sixth Marine Division
effected a landing on a hostile shore, captured an important airdrome,
and fought its way over rugged terrain against enemy resistance
a distance of 84 miles securing an area of 436 square
miles of Japanese territory. Over 2200 enemy dead have been
counted in addition to the capture of large numbers of assorted
weapons and quantities of military stores.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. The Sixth Marine Division may well be proud of its achievements.
Its units have operated in combat with distinction. The
attack and seizure of precipitous <abbr title='mount'>Mt.</abbr> YAETAKE on MOTOBU Peninsula
will stand out in our history as an example of courage and determination
of the individual Marine to surmount impassable terrain
defended by a well organized and fanatical foe. Your accomplishments
have demonstrated a standard of proficiency in battle
equal to any unit in the Fleet Marine Force.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. In addition to the fighting ability of the assault troops,
the Commanding General commends the supporting units for their
untiring and efficient operation which enabled the attack to
maintain its momentum throughout the operation. Artillery,
Tanks, Engineers, Shore Party, Medical and Service elements of
the division all contributed their share to bring the campaign to
a successful and rapid conclusion.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. The Sixth Marine Division has lived up to the highest
traditions of the Marine Corps and can proudly take its place
among the other famous Marine organizations which have brought
glory and honor to our illustrious Corps.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. In rejoicing over our recently achieved victory, we should
not forget to honor our fallen comrades and those who have suffered
wounds in battle. The loss of those who made the supreme sacrifice
is deeply mourned by all who survived. The memory of their sacrifice
will remain with us always.</p>

<p class='c005'>1. The Commanding General wishes to commend the Twenty-second
Marines for their outstanding performance of duty during
the period from 8 May 1945 to the present date.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. On 8 May 1945, the Twenty-second Marines was assigned
the extreme right flank of the Third Amphibious Corps zone of
action. At that time the forward line in this sector ran from the
west coast inland just south of Machinato airfield. The enemy
positions facing them were recognized to be of an extremely
formidable nature and had withstood attack for many days.</p>

<p class='c005'>Undeterred by the grim prospects confronting them the
Twenty-second Marines upon receiving the order to attack, immediately
began a determined skillful advance to the south.</p>

<p class='c005'>The regiment rapidly forced its way to the Asa-Kwan estuary
and upon reaching that formidable natural barrier, unhesitatingly
forded the fire swept water course and established a firm bridgehead
on the southern side.</p>

<p class='c005'>The following day, the attack was resumed, this time
against the enemy main line of resistance lodged on commanding
ground honeycombed with tunnels, caves, and pillboxes. In the
face of devastating artillery, mortar and machine gun fire, the
regiment unhesitatingly hammered its way up the fanatically defended
slopes and by its persistent, dogged determination
breached the enemy defenses and seized the tactically important
high ground overlooking Naha.</p>

<p class='c005'>Since the seizure of this important area, the regiment has
demonstrated its tenacity in holding ground gained against repeated
enemy counter-attacks and counter-landings.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. The Sixth Marine Division looks with pride on the accomplishments
of the Twenty-second Marines. The esprit de corps,
courageous determination, and outstanding fighting ability of
this regiment is worthy of the greatest praise.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. Let us not forget that these achievements have not been
without cost. The glory gained belongs equally to those who so
unsparingly gave their lives in the performance of their duty. The
battle is not yet won, and hard fighting lies ahead, but it behooves
those who remain to resolve to maintain the inspired standards
established by the recent accomplishments of this regiment.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1. Reference (a) is quoted below for the information of all
members of this command:</p>

<p class='c010'>“1. During the period from 1 to 10 April 1945 inclusive
the Shore Party of the SIXTH Marine Division worked in closest
cooperation and harmony with Transport Squadron TWELVE
(Transport Group ABLE), ships under its operational control,
and with all elements of the Navy beach and control parties
of the squadron. During this period some 51,920 tons of cargo
were landed on and handled over the reef and sent to dumps and
dispersal areas in the rear. At no time were the beaches allowed
to become congested with cargo to the detriment of
progress in general cargo unloading. At the end of the unloading
period all cargo was clear of the beach areas, beaches
were clean and free of wreckage, cargo nets and life preservers
had been salvaged and returned to ships, and Garrison
Shore and Beach Parties were completely stationed, well instructed
in their duties and fully functioning.</p>

<p class='c013'>“2. At no time, night or day, did unloading operations
completely cease on RED and GREEN Beaches. Upon ‘all clear’
after RED alert, work was resumed promptly. At all times men
were made available over and beyond the normal demands whenever
an emergency of one type or another arose. At no time
was there any complaint that the men were too tired to work:—that
they were tired goes without question, but that they
carried on is a tribute to their physical stamina, the morale
of the individual marine, and to the quality of their leadership.</p>

<p class='c013'>“3. Commander Transport Squadron TWELVE (Commander
Transport Group ABLE) strongly urges that the Commanding
General, SIXTH Marine Division publish this appreciation of
the superb work done by his Shore Party to all hands in his
division so that all may know that their Shore Party contributed
very materially to their recent success. It can be said
in all truth that the SIXTH Marine Division Shore Party is
the best in every respect so far seen in this war, and its
organization, equipment and functioning deserve close study
as a model for future operations.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='Page_44'></a>“4. ——</p>

<p class='c013'>“5. ——</p>

<p class='c013'>“6. In conclusion may we in Transport Squadron TWELVE
express the hope that at some future date we may be so
fortunate as to serve with the SIXTH Marine Division again.
Everywhere we found splendid cooperation, a thorough knowledge
of what you wanted to do and a keen appreciation of our
own problems which enabled us to solve often vexing details
in a highly satisfactory manner. We know that we have seen
the best examples of the ship-to-shore movement to date, and
we leave you with highest regards and best wishes for your
continued success.</p>

zone of action ended today. In the 82 days which have passed since
the division landed on the YONTAN beaches much ground has been
gained, many Japs killed and numerous localities of great importance
to our nation have been captured. These continuing
successes have only been realized through the superb performance
of duty on the part of every unit throughout the division. The
aggressive conduct of units in contact with the enemy coupled
with the tireless support rendered by units behind the lines,
both tactical and logistical, are in keeping with the indomitable
fighting spirit of which this division is so justly proud. Every
officer and man may look upon the activities of the past three
months as a hard job superbly accomplished.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>APPENDIX “C” <br /> Sixth Marine Division Insignia</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The basic design for the shoulder patch of the Sixth Marine Division was submitted
by Colonel Victor Bleasdale of the Twenty Ninth Marines. The design as finally
adopted, incorporated ideas of Corporal Michael W. Pawl and Major General Lemuel C.
Shepherd, Jr. The artist who actually drew and colored the design was Lieutenant
George Thompson.</p>

<p class='c005'>The outside diameter of the patch is three inches and the diameter of the inner
circle is two and one fourth inches. Embroidered on the red outer border are the words
Melanesia—Micronesia—Orient. Superimposed upon a crusader sword in the center of
the patch is a one and a quarter inch block numeral “6”, two inches long. The shading
of the “6” is in the same color as the outer border. The “6” and the lettering of the
words on the border is golden yellow. Cobalt blue is the color of the center background
and the crusader sword is silver white.</p>

<p class='c005'>To commemorate the fighting in the Solomons of the Raider Battalions, from which
the Fourth Regiment was formed, the word Melanesia was chosen. Similarly, the word
Micronesia commemorates the fighting of the Twenty Second Marines at Eniwetok, the
First Provisional Brigade on Guam, and the First Battalion, Twenty Ninth Marines, at
Saipan.</p>

<p class='c005'>The board of officers, representing all units of the division, which adopted the patch
selected the word Orient for two reasons: First, because China was the home of the old
Fourth Marine Regiment, lost in the early days of the war on Bataan. The Raider Battalions
were the units used to reactivate the Fourth Marines. The second reason advanced
by the board was, that it was their belief that in its final stages, the war
against Japan would have to be fought in the Orient. It is significant that the division
took part in the last campaign, which was fought on Okinawa, and, as predicted, in
the Orient.</p>

<p class='c005'>The crusader’s sword was chosen as a symbol of the Sixth Marine Division’s crusade
against the tyrannical principles of the axis powers.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a special order, dated 17 October 1944, General Shepherd brought the insignia
into official existence.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
